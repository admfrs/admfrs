                        <h2><font color ="white">Foot marching has been one of my activities since I was in lower secondary school.Since I was in standard four,
I have been learned marching.My teacher; sergeant from the Malay land army regiment. from the Tapah unit.What I 
remember is fierce, only god knows. my love for the foot march is very deep. It's unspeakable and I'm sure, the 
foot march has helped me build my selfconfidence that I owned till this day,not only marching but since i joined 
sports too between sweet experiences while marching; i can say it's time to represent the school in the state 
competition, get 3rd place.Well, still worth it, lost to Izzudin high school, a strong district in KRS.Then, once 
again the school representative to march in conjunction with national independence day 2017 and its really fun.
Not in vain foot marching until my legs cramp, indeed the most beautiful memory and that was the best team i have
ever had.</h2>
